                               Tech Summary - The School Boyz Mini Golf Challenge

      First of all i hope it is ok that this is a .txt file not a Word document, sorry about that.

      For our game, I had the role of "code-monkey", meaning that i was the main person doing the code. When all is said,
and done, I believe i fulfilled this role to the best of my ability. Matt and I were the only people who worked on
the main code. Aside from the things that Matt mentioned in his personal statement, I wrote everything else in the
code. This includes the entire structure of the code, the Start and End Creen, many of the checkwalls() functions,
and the main Hole_1 file where all of the Hole classes' methods are called.

      I put in a lot of effort and time into this project, and in the end I am happy with the result. I probably put in 
more time than anyone else, but i dont really mind, as i was the "code-monkey" and everyone on the team still helped
out. Overall, i think we worked well as a team, with me doing the code, Matt helping out with code and Nirav and Tyler
checking for bugs and creating the hole designs. 

      If there was one thing i would change, I would find a to close our "bug #1", which the fact that the ball 
occasionally goes through the wall. Other than that one bug, i think our final prduct is a good one, and clearly 
the result of hard work by all of the team members. I feel that i was a good team member and i fulfilled my role
of "code monkey".
